Are trees green or are they orange? Is the sky blue or is it gray?

Looking out my window I see trees with orange leaves against a gray sky. Six
months from now, even sitting in the same seat, things will look very different.

To make sense of the information around us we must assess context. My writing
is no different. I'll do my best to be honest and present information that I
hope will be of use to others. However, the reader must critically evaluate the
information. Part of that is considering the perspective that I'm viewing things
from.

Here are a few details that color my perception.

# Company characteristics

## Number of staff

A company can range from a sole proprietor to millions of employees.

My experience has been working at organizations of just under 50 people to just
over 1,000 people. I've led single teams of three up to departments of over
three hundred. Prior to this I spent seven years as a sole proprietor.

## Stage

Some businesses were started yesterday and others, amazingly, are over a
thousand years old.

I've specifically worked at companies that identified as "startups". These
ranged from those founded less than two years prior to my joining to those that
had already been in business nearly a decade.

## On-site vs remote

I've worked remotely since 2008.

## Industry

I've worked at technology companies. The majority of these were B2B. One was
B2C. Most of these focused on providing software or sevices to software
engineers, such as: distributed database, in-memory data grid, Ruby on Rails
PaaS, log storage and analysis, etc. I have also worked at two FinTech
companies, one directly servicing end consumers and one that provided BaaS.
