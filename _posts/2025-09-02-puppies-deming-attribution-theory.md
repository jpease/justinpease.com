After 16 years of cat ownership—who owned who is left to the reader—we got puppies. Our first ones. Super cute. Endless snuggles. Also: puddles and piles (if you know, you know).

A mindset that helps us through the messy and destructive moments is:

> “Everything is your fault.”

Dogs do dog things. And if that dog thing isn't something I like—it's on me for allowing an environment and opportunity for that to happen. If I want different outcomes, I need to change the setup. Their actions are a reflection of my own.

Which naturally reminded me of W. Edwards Deming.

He estimated that 90-95% of organizational problems stem from the system, not the individual (_Out of the Crisis_). The Deming Institute explains it this way:

> [“the system that people work in and the interaction with people may account for 90 or 95 percent of performance.”](https://deming.org/deming-on-management-appreciation-for-a-system/)

Dog trainers understand this. Cesar Millan's tagline isn't 'fix the dog'—it's 'train the human.' Which makes you wonder whether more business leaders should stick to goldfish instead of dogs. But I digress.

This connects to a bigger idea: attribution theory—the way we make sense of outcomes. The stories we tell ourselves about success and failure. If I blame chance, others, or unfairness, I become powerless—trapped by forces outside my control. But if I recognize my part in it, it gives me a lever to change things.

For example, if I get angry at one of the pups for chewing my shoe, we both have a bad day and the cycle is guaranteed to repeat. If I realize he couldn't have done it if I had put my shoes out of reach, the cycle is broken.

This simple principle holds true in business and life in general.

When _everything is my fault_, I hold the leash. I choose where we go.
