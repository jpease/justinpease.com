We’ve had cats for 16 years. Now we’ve got puppies. Our first ones. Overwhelming cuteness, endless snuggles—and occasionally sheer chaos.

A quote that helps us through the messy and destructive moments is:

> “Everything is your fault.”

Dogs are going to do dog things. If they do something I didn’t want—it's on me for allowing an environment and opportunity for that to happen. If I want different outcomes, I need to change the setup.

Which naturally reminded me of W. Edwards Deming.

He estimated that around 94% of problems in an organization come from the system, not the individual (_Out of the Crisis_). The Deming Institute explains it this way:

> [“the system that people work in and the interaction with people may account for 90 or 95 percent of performance.”](https://deming.org/deming-on-management-appreciation-for-a-system/)

Cesar Millan gets it. His tagline isn't 'fix the dog'—it's 'train the human.' Which makes you wonder whether more business leaders should stick to goldfish instead of dogs.

That also reminded me of attribution theory—the stories we tell ourselves to explain success and failure. If I see a mistake as caused by chance, others, or an unfair situation—I’m powerless. But if I recognize my part in it, even if small, I regain control. It gives me a lever to change things.

For example, if I get angry at one of the pups for chewing my shoe, we both have a bad day and the cycle is guaranteed to repeat. If I realize he couldn't have done it if I had put my shoes out of reach, the cycle is broken.

This simple principle holds true in business and life in general.

Whether it’s puppies, management, or life—when everything is _my fault_, it also means I can change it.
