You’re at dinner.  
Someone’s talking to you.  
And without thinking, you glance at your phone.

Just a second.  
But it’s a vote.

A vote for distraction.  
A vote for becoming someone who isn't really there.

And here's the thing: You know who you want to be.  
So why aren't you becoming them?

It's not time, motivation, or circumstance.  
The answer lies in what we actually are.

Who we are---is what we do.

## The stark reality

There is no fixed self. We're under constant construction.

Every day, through countless micro-decisions, we're molding who we are.  
We don't find ourselves---some predetermined essence---but shape ourselves through our choices.

We think these are just things we do.  
They're not---they're who we're becoming.

Ten years from now, you’ll be exactly who your daily choices made you. No exceptions.  
And here’s the part that should make us squirm:  
most of this is happening on autopilot.

**_Right now_, we may be becoming someone we don't want to be.**

Not dramatically.  
But through the compound effect of daily decisions:  
to scroll instead of speak,  
to drift instead of strive.

The person who wants to be an early riser  
but stays up late scrolling  
becomes someone who can't seem to reach that goal.

The person who wants to be healthier  
but fills their grocery cart with junk  
becomes someone who sabotages themself.

They don’t mean to become that person.  
But they do---  
one unnoticed vote at a time.

So why do we keep making choices that work against us?

## Break the Loop Before It Becomes You

If we want to change who we're becoming, we have to start with paying attention to what we're reinforcing---what we're voting for---every time we act.

Every choice is a fight  
between who we are (craving ease)  
and who we could become (requiring effort).

Present self almost always wins---  
louder, more urgent, more persuasive.  
It calls the shots.

The chronically angry person isn't choosing to be angry---  
they're choosing not to pause before reacting.

The chronically cash-strapped person isn't choosing financial hardship---  
they're choosing the immediate purchase over the long-term plan.

But the pattern of our choices becomes our identity.  
And the identity reinforces the choices.

Breaking the loop doesn’t take willpower---it takes strategy.

Here are three ways to start paying attention:

**First, audit your votes.**  
For one week, catch yourself in the small moments.  
What are you voting for when you pick up your phone mid-conversation?  
When you choose Netflix over that project you keep postponing?  
Just notice---without judgment.

**Second, design your circumstances.**  
Stop relying on willpower.  
Start changing your environment.  
Phone in another room during meals.  
Workout clothes laid out the night before.  
Make the good choice the easy choice.

**Third, use the 10-10-10 rule.**  
Before making a decision, ask:  
How will I feel about this in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 years?  
This shifts the perspective  
from immediate gratification to long-term construction.

Say you're debating whether to go for a run.

In 10 minutes, you'll probably feel tired---but accomplished.  
In 10 months, you might feel stronger and more disciplined.  
In 10 years, you may have built a body and mindset you're truly proud of.

These strategies work because they acknowledge a simple truth.

## The fundamental truth

We're always becoming someone---the question is whether we're paying attention.

Here’s what it comes down to.  
Who we are is what we do.

And while not always easy,  
that means we each have the power to choose who we become.

But it starts with a clear-eyed look at who we've already become.

> _We are not our thoughts or intentions._  
> _Not our beliefs, excuses, or potential._
>
> **_We are our patterns._**

If an outsider observed your behavior for a month,  
what would they conclude about your priorities, your character, your values?

That outsider is seeing your real identity.  
The person you’re becoming through your choices.

Don't sleepwalk into your future self.  
Start casting those votes now.

## The question

Picture your best self.

**What would they do right now?**

Not tomorrow.
Not someday.
Not when conditions are perfect.

_Right now._

**Do that.**

Right now, in this moment, you're casting a vote.  
Make it count.

Because in the end,  
we don't become what we imagine.  
We become what we repeat.
