If you're going to make an assumption, **assume that additional clarification is
needed**.

Have ever had an experience like this?

Sound at all familiar? I know it's happened to me.

If sometimes we're not 100% sure what the words that just came out of our own
mouth mean, then it seems safe to assume that we're scoring well below that when
it comes to understanding others.

**So what can we do?**

Clarifying questions are a great way to improve our understanding, reduce
miscommunications, and show that we value and care about the person/topic.
