**This post is part of [The Words We Use](/2022/12/18/the-words-we-use) series.**

During an interview this morning I was asked about how I approach deadlines. My
answer began with something like:

> "I'm not sure of deadline's etymology, but it doesn't sound friendly. It would
seem to imply that if the line is crossed, death will result. Or at the very
least, there will be some very serious consequences. In my experience, deadlines
are often artificial and arbitrary, organizationally self-imposed, and are not a
matter of life or death."

Curiosity prompted me to later seek out the history of the word.

According to various sources, including 
[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/your-deadline-wont-kill-you),
the word starts to appear in written records during the 1860s, specifically in
connection with the Civil War.

The original meaning was, just as it sounds, a line around prisoners beyond
which they would be shot dead. One work quoted by Merriam-Webster highlights a
psychological angle of the tool:

> "The guard lines are drawn in; making our play grounds much smaller and
cutting us off from our best well of water, this is done for no other purpose
under the sun but to interfere with our only enjoyment and to grind us to the
lowest depth of subjugation."

To me, a direct comparison between prisoners at risk of death and modern-day
workers' at-will employment seems inappropriate. A bit overdramatic, even for
me. Nevertheless, in the spirit of this series, I do wonder whether the
negative overtones carry through. Whether familiar with the word's history or
not, the picture it paints and the feeling it conveys is clear:

**Cross this line and there will be seriously bad consequences.**

Like the above picture of a dead tree in a barren West Texas landscape,
"deadline" ominously portends difficult times ahead. It made me ask myself:

* Is that the message I'm trying to convey?
* Is the timeline truly so rigid that no adjustments can be considered?
* Are hints of threatening outcomes, even if admittedly subtle, the best way to
inspire staff to achieve their peak performance?

For me, the answer to the above is No. I think words such as goal, estimate,
projection, or delivery date would better communicate both the thought and the
intended feeling.
