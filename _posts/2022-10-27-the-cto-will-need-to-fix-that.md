**"The CTO will need to fix that."**

This phrase should reflexively cause a reaction. I'm not saying it will always
be a red flag if the CTO (or any other person) is the only one who can fix
something, but I think it should at least prompt a moment of reflection.

# When it's not a red flag

*Very* early on in a startup a few unique situations can arise. Perhaps no
other technical staff have been hired yet. Or perhaps they were hired so
recently that the CTO has not yet ramped them up on this specific topic.

Those are legitimate scenarios. However, I'd suggest they still deserve a yellow
flag. You've uncovered something that needs to be addressed sooner rather than
later.

There are other scenarios where you need the CTO to do something that is
specific to the role of CTO. For example, Sales may need the CTO to meet with
a potential customer to close a deal. That's not what we're talking about here.

# Everything else... it's a red flag

What's the big deal? Perhaps the CTO likes handling these types of challenges.
And I bet most of us are less likely to hand off a responsibility we really
enjoy doing ourself.

So again, what's the big deal? Here's the four angles I'd consider.

1. **Business continuity.**  
We don't need to consider anything as grim as the bus factor. Let's take the
cheerier topic of vacation. If any day-to-day operational task requires one
specific person to handle, how can that person ever take vacation? Everyone
deserves a distraction-free vacation. Even the CTO.

    But also, *seriously*, the bus-factor. Unexpected things happen unexpectedly.

2. **Team morale.**  
If it wasn't for whatever reason the CTO needs to handle this situation, who
would normally handle it? You likely hired smart people to solve challenging
problems. In my experience, when those individuals are unable to do their job
and have to call in the CTO, this contributes towards frustration. This
compounds if it happens with frequency. Even more so if for the same issue.

    Instead, this can be an excellent training opportunity. Level up those
around you.

3. **Product smell.**  
If some part of the product is so *something* that only the CTO can fix it,
that should prompt questions like: What is that *something*? Is it insufficient
documentation? Is that part of the product especially fragile or riddled with
technical debt?

    If it can be fixed, and it almost certainly can be, then it should be.

4. **Missed opportunity.**  
If in fact the domain you are working in is so complex or custom that the above
identified *something* cannot be addressed in product but instead requires
highly specialized hands-on work, perhaps it represents an opportunity. This
sounds a lot like Professional Services, which may very well be billable.
