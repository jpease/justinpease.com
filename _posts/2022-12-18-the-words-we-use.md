Words are the tools by which we exchange thoughts. Whether we do so with
intention, or not, they convey not only facts but also feelings. These building
blocks of communication can add a subtle color.

The old barn in the picture didn't fall into this state of disrepair overnight.
Rain fell and the wind blew. Owners changed and seasons passed. Moss grew and
wood rotted. I wonder whether the nuances, the subtle connotations, of the words
we use have a similar cumulative effect. Perhaps inconsequential in isolation,
when compounded by time are they building up or eroding our organization's
culture?

This series will attempt to capture examples of the above.
